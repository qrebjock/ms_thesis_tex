In this master thesis,
we investigated high-dimensional feature selection
in the gaussian knockoffs framework setting.
In high dimension, nearly all the steps of the selection procedure become challenging,
and in particular the construction of the knockoff features,
and the computation of statistics associated to each aggregated feature.

Building knockoffs inducing a high statistical power relies on the optimization of a semidefinite program.
Hopefully, the structure and the simple bounds of this SDP allow us to perform coordinate ascent which
is guaranteed to converge in this case.
On top of that, a low-rank approximation structure speeds up the computations by several order of magnitude.
Experiments show that this approach keeps a reasonably high power.

Applications to a wider range of datasets, such as fMRI or will be explored in future work.
