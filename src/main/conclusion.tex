In this master thesis,
we investigated high-dimensional feature selection
in the gaussian knockoffs framework setting.
In high dimension, nearly all the steps of the selection procedure become challenging,
and in particular the construction of the knockoff features,
and the computation of statistics associated to each aggregated feature.

Building knockoffs inducing a high statistical power relies on the optimization of a semidefinite program.
Hopefully, the structure and the simple bounds of this SDP
