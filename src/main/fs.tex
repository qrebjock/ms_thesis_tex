\chapter{Feature selection}\label{ch:fs}

We introduce in this chapter the concepts of feature selection and false discovery rate control,
as well as a short review of a few methods that are usually employed,
including the Lasso and Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg-Yekutieli procedures.

\section{Background on feature selection}\label{sec:bfs}

\subsection{Definitions}\label{subsec:fs_defs}

Feature selection primarily consists in identifying the most relevant features (or covariates)
explaining an observed variable.
It is closely related to Occam's razor which is a principle stating that
the simplest explanation is often the best one.
More formally, let $\cX$ be a $p$-dimensional random vector representing observed features
and $\cY$ a random target that may depend on $\cX$.
For example, $\cX$ could be the expression levels of the genes of an individual,
and $\cY \in \zoset$ a binary response indicating whether or not the person has some disease.
We wish to find the subset of covariates $\cS \subseteq \fset$ that best explains the target $\cY$,
be it a numerical or a categorical variable.
The notion of relevance of a feature $\cX_j$ can be captured by the dependence of $\cY$ on $\cX_j$.
To do so, suppose that the joint vector $\left( \cX,\, \cY \right)$ follows some distribution,
that is $\left( \cX,\, \cY \right) \sim \mathcal{P}_{\cX,\, \cY}$.
Even though finding the full conditional distribution $\cP_{\cY \mid \cX}$ is beyond hope in general,
one may be interested in finding on which subset $\cS$ of features $\cP_{\cY \mid \cX}$ depends.
As this set is not necessarily unique,
the principle of parsimony motivates us to find the smallest one.
In other words, we are interested in finding the smallest subset $\cS$ such that
$\cY \mid \left\{ \cX_j \right\}_{j \in \cS}$ is independent of $\left\{ \cX_j \right\}_{j \notin \cS}$.
Such a subset is called a Markov Blanket~\citep{markov_blanket, markov_blanket_fs}
and is not necessarily unique as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fs_subset_not_unique}.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{figures/fs_subset_not_unique.pdf}
    \caption{
        Illustration of the non-uniqueness of the Markov blanket~\citep{model_x_knockoffs}.
        Here $\cX_1 \sim \cN\left( 0,\, 1 \right)$
        and $\cX_2 \sim \cN\left( 0,\, 1 \right)$ are independent,
        $\cX_3 = \cX_1 - \cX_2$.
        $\cY$ is $\cC_+$ if $\cX_1 + \cX_2 \geq 0$,
        $\cC_-$ otherwise.
        The target $\cY$ can be predicted directly from any of the pairs
        $\left( \cX_1,\, \cX_2 \right)$, $\left( \cX_2,\, \cX_3 \right)$, $\left( \cX_1,\, \cX_3 \right)$.
    }
    \label{fig:fs_subset_not_unique}
\end{figure}
But this example is pathological because a feature is an exact linear combination of the two others.
Under weak conditions, there exist a unique Markov Blanket containing the set of features of interest.
\begin{remark}
    In that case, the Markov Blanket coincides with the set of features
    which are said to be pairwise conditional independent.
    We define the set of null features $\cH_0 \subseteq \fset$ as follows:
    $j \in \cH_0$ if and only if $\cY \independent \cX_j \mid \cX_{-j}$
    (where $\cX_{-j}$ denotes that all vector entries are kept except the $j$th).
    The relevant set is then $\cS = \fset \setminus \cH_0$
    and the goal is to find a subset of features $\hat{\cS} \subseteq \fset$ as close to $\cS$ as possible.
\end{remark}
As a matter of example,
consider the case of linear regression where we assume that the target and the features follow a linear relationship
\begin{equation*}
    \cY = \cX^\top \bbeta + \epsilon
\end{equation*}
where $\bbeta \in \R^p$ and $\epsilon$ is a gaussian noise,
feature selection would consist in identifying which coefficients of $\bbeta$ are non null.

In practice, one would observe several independent realizations of
$\left( \cX,\, \cY \right)$ and would aggregate them into a feature matrix
$X \in \R^{n \times p}$ of $n$ samples and $p$ features, and a target vector $\yy \in \R^n$ respectively.
The independence of the observations is a credible assumption in many real life settings

\subsection{Motivation}\label{subsec:fs_motivation}

Feature selection may be used in a multitude of contexts.
Sometimes, people are not even interested in the most relevant features
but just want to reduce the size of their dataset.
We point out here the main benefits of performing it on a dataset.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Making a model more interpretable.}
    When a statistical model is built, for example linear regression,
    one is often interested in the weights attributed to each feature.
    It gives insights regarding the impact of a given feature on the target.
    In the era of deep learning~\citep{deep_learning},
    many machine learning models contain millions of parameters and are not interpretable at all anymore.
    Feature selection may be a way to reduce the number of parameters and concentrate on the few pertinent ones,
    thus reducing the model complexity.
    \item \textit{Facilitating data visualization.}
    Visualizing data may give a lot of intuition and understanding on a phenomenon.
    Our perceptions are known to be misleading in high dimension,
    and even in 3 dimensions~\citep{graphical_perception}.
    For this reason, many algorithms, as $t$-SNE for example~\citep{t_sne},
    try to project the high-dimensional data to a more accessible space.
    But that step is costly, and the fewer features, the more representative the output will be.
    Pre-selecting a small subset of impactful features can usually greatly improve the results of such projections.
    \item \textit{Reducing the training time.}
    Many machine learning algorithm have a super-linear time complexity in the number of features.
    Pre-selecting a small subset with a cheaper method
    can noticeably improve performances~\citep{high_dimensional_fs}.
    \item \textit{Improving the generalization of machine learning models.}
    Test accuracy can be increased when a model is trained only on significant features~\citep{fs_overfit}.
    Training a model against irrelevant features is prone to over-fitting noise.
    \item \textit{Avoiding the curse of dimensionality}~\citep{curse_dimensionality}.
    For example, the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm~\citep{knn} is known to perform badly as the feature space
    dimension increases.
    The number of samples actually has to grow exponentially in the number of features in order for the algorithm
    to perform decently.
\end{enumerate}
Recently, the cost of measuring more features has drastically decreased.
Many datasets, and especially in biology, end up with several dozens of thousands of features.
Most of these features are expected to be insignificant, but there is a priori no reason not to collect them.
Expanding the feature matrix is cheap, and it is then the role of machine learning algorithms
to detect relevant columns subsequently.

\subsection{Techniques}\label{subsec:fst}

There exist a lot of different paradigms and techniques
to perform feature selection~\citep{intro_fs, fs_for_classification_a_review}.
Simplest approaches calculate a score for each feature and rank them accordingly;
only those with the highest score are kept.
The problem of this is that features that may seem meaningless alone
can turn out to be worthwhile when coupled with other features.

In general,
different schemes have to be used depending
on the type of data and the field of study~\citep{fs_text_classification, gene_selection_cancer_svm, fs_for_classification}.
We detail here only two methods to which we will come back later.

\subsubsection{Lasso}\label{subsubsec:lasso}

First rediscovered by~\cite{lasso},
the Lasso has become increasingly popular because of its capacity to both shrink
the coefficients of a linear regression towards $0$, and to select a subset of the features.
It is basically a linear least squares regression whose weights are penalized by their $\ell_1$ norm,
multiplied by some factor $\lambda > 0$.
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lasso}
    \hat{\bbeta}(\lambda) =
    \underset{\bb}{\argmin}\;
    \frac{1}{2}\norm{\yy - X\bb}_2^2 + \lambda\norm{\bb}_1
\end{equation}
%
The $\ell_1$ penalty tends to make the weights $\hat{\bbeta}(\lambda)$ sparser as $\lambda$ increases.
Actually, for any feature $j$,
there is a $\lambda_{\min}$ such that for all $\lambda \geq \lambda_{\min}$,
$\hat{\bbeta}_j(\lambda) = 0$.
That wouldn't be the case with an $\ell_2$ penalty,
for which the coefficients usually tend to $0$ without reaching that value.
This property makes the Lasso particularly suited for feature selection;
just keep the features whose weight is non-zero.
However, the choice of $\lambda$ seems to be arbitrary,
especially as it's not possible to know beforehand how many features will be selected.

The behavior of the mapping $\lambda \mapsto \hat{\bbeta}(\lambda)$ has been extensively studied,
and the algorithm LARS~\citep{lars} was developed to efficiently compute it.
It is possible to do so because this path is piecewise linear.
It allows to compute $\hat{\bbeta}$ for all relevant values of $\lambda$ at a marginal cost.
In practice, the value of $\lambda$ giving the highest score on cross-validation is picked.
The $\ell_1$ regularization can easily be extended to many other estimators than the least squares,
as for example logistic regression or SVMs.

\subsubsection{Sparse center classifiers}

Nearest centroid classification~\citep{centroid_classification} is a very simple classification scheme.
When there are only two labels,
it consists in computing the averages $\btheta^\pm = \sum_{j \in \cI^\pm} \xx_i \in \R^p$
of the data points from the positive and negative classes $\cC^\pm$,
where $\cI^\pm$ contain the positive and the negative points.
A new data point $\xx \in \R^p$ is classified positive or negative depending on its closest average
$\btheta^+$ or $\btheta^-$.
Finding the class averages can be formulated as the following optimization problem.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:centroids_averages}
    \argmin_{\btheta^+,\, \btheta^-}
        \frac{1}{n^+} \sum_{i \in \cI^+} \big\lVert \xx_i - \btheta^+ \big\rVert^2_2
        + \frac{1}{n^-} \sum_{i \in \cI^-} \big\lVert \xx_i - \btheta^- \big\rVert^2_2
\end{equation}
Note now $\Delta$ the decision boundary,
such that $\xx$ is classified $\cC^+$ if $\Delta\left( \xx \right) > 0$ and $\cC^-$ otherwise.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:centroids_boundary}
    \Delta(\xx) = \norm{\xx - \btheta^-}^2_2 - \norm{\xx - \btheta^+}^2_2
\end{equation}
The expression~\ref{eq:centroids_boundary} can be expanded into
$\Delta(\xx) = \norm{\btheta^+}^2_2 + \norm{\btheta^-}^2_2 + 2\xx^\top(\btheta^+ - \btheta^-)$,
making it clear that the decision depends on the feature $j$ if and only if $\btheta^+_j \neq \btheta^-_j$.
Using this observation~\cite{sparse_center_classifiers} introduced in~\ref{eq:centroids_averages}
an additional $\ell_0$-norm constraint $\norm{\btheta^+ - \btheta^-}_0 \leq k$,
such that at most $k$ entries of $\btheta^+$ and $\btheta^-$ are different.
They show that this version can be solved very efficiently in closed-form.
The authors obtain accuracy scores on par with the ones of the Lasso on the datasets they experiment.
This a sparse centroid classification allows notably to perform feature selection
by keeping the features $j$ such that $\btheta^+_j \neq \btheta^-_j$.

\bigbreak
None of the selection scheme presented above offer strong guarantees regarding
the number of false positives that are detected.
The selected subset $\hat{\cS}$ could potentially be disjoint to $\cS$
if the selection criterion is not adapted to the problem.

\section{False discovery rate control}\label{sec:fdrc}

When performing feature selection one is usually interested in two quantities,
namely the \emph{false discovery rate} (FDR) and the \emph{power}.
Intuitively, the former (resp.\ the latter) assesses the expected proportion of false discoveries
(resp.\ true discoveries) of a selection procedure.

\subsection{Definitions}\label{subsec:fdr_def}

Suppose the conditional probability distribution $\cY \mid \cX$ depends only on a subset of features
$\cS \subset \left\{ 1, \dots, p \right\}$.
A feature selection algorithm outputs a subset $\hat{\cS} \subset \fset$ (which is potentially random)
that it judges to be relevant.
The false discovery proportion (FDR), the false discovery rate (FDR), and the power are defined as follows
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fdr_def}
    \fdp = \frac
        {\big\lvert \big\{ \hat{\cS} \setminus \cS \big\} \big\rvert}
        {\lvert \hat{\cS} \rvert}
    \text{,}\qquad\quad
    \fdr = \Eb{\fdp}
    \text{,}\qquad\quad
    \power = \E{
        \frac
            {\big\lvert \big\{ \hat{\cS} \cap \cS \big\} \big\rvert}
            {\lvert\hat{\cS}\rvert}
    }
\end{equation}
The $\fdp$ merely measures the proportion of features in $\hat{\cS}$ that are not in $\cS$.
It depends on the samples $X$ and $\yy$,
and possibly on the inherent randomness of the selection algorithm.
That is why the $\fdr$ assesses the expectation of this value.
Finally, the $\power$ is the fraction of the important features that were actually discovered, in average.

Even though it is beyond hope to retrieve the whole set $\mathcal{S}$ with no error,
a multitude of techniques attempt to find as many relevant features as possible
(that is, maximizing the power)
while maintaining the FDR under a certain threshold.
The concept of $\fdr$ was first introduced by~\cite{bh} and has become increasingly decisive in some
sciences such has biology
where the acquisition of a huge number of covariates is frequent~\cite{statistical_inference_genome}.
It is now possible to measure the expression levels of several dozens of thousands of genes for a given individual.

\subsection{Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg-Yekutieli procedures}\label{subsec:bhq}

The BJ~\citep{bh} and BY~\citep{by} schemes are two methods controlling the FDR
that are widely used in practice.
They are closely related to each other but offer different guarantees regarding the effective control of the FDR\@.
BH is less conservative than BY but makes stronger assumptions on the $p$-values it manipulates.

For each feature $j \in \fset$, let $\cH_j$ be the null hypothesis ($j$ does not belong to $\cS$),
and $\pvalue_j$ the corresponding $p$-value.
Let $\fdrtarget \in [0, 1]$ be some FDR target that should not be exceeded.
We note $(\pvalue_{(j)})_j$ the sequence of $p$-values in increasing order;
$\pvalue_{(1)} \leq \dots \leq \pvalue_{(p)}$.
Let $m_0$ be the number of true null hypotheses.

\subsubsection{Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg}\label{subsubsec:bh}

The Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg (BH) procedure was the first method proposed to control the FDR\@.
It consists in the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sorting the $p$-values such that $\pvalue_{(1)} \leq \ldots \leq \pvalue_{(p)}$
    \item Finding the largest $k \in \N$ such that $\pvalue_{(k)} \leq \frac{k \cdot \fdrtarget}{p}$
    \item Rejecting all the hypotheses $\cH_{(j)}$ such that $j \in \left\{ 1, \dots, k \right\}$
\end{enumerate}
In the end, all the features $j$ such that $p_j \leq p_{(k)}$ are selected.
It guarantees that $\fdr \leq \frac{m_0}{p}\fdrtarget$ under the assumption that the $p$-values were computed
independently, which can be very restrictive in many situations.

\subsubsection{Benjaminiâ€“Yekutieli}\label{subsubsec:by}

Similarly, the Benjaminiâ€“Yekutieli procedure controls the FDR
and does not need the $p$-values independence assumption,
at the cost of a more conservative selection.
It follows the same scheme, namely:
ordering the $p$-values,
finding the largest $k \in \N$ such that $\pvalue_{(k)} \leq \frac{k}{p \cdot c(p)}\fdrtarget$,
and rejecting $\cH_{(j)}$ if $j \leq k$.
Note the additional factor $c(p) \geq 1$, defined in~\ref{eq:by_factor}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:by_factor}
c(p) = \sum_{j = 1}^p \frac{1}{j}
,\qquad
\fdr \leq \frac{m_0}{p}\fdrtarget
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.\textwidth]{figures/bhy.pdf}
    \caption{
        Illustration of the BH and the BY procedures.
        Once the $p$-values are ordered,
        they are geometrically equivalent to drawing a line of slope $\beta$ going through the origin,
        identifying the last $p$-value under the line, and keeping features on its left.
        For BH, $\beta = \frac{\fdrtarget}{p}$ (in blue),
        while for BY, $\beta = \frac{\fdrtarget}{p \cdot c(p)}$ (in brown).
        In this toy example, $\fdrtarget = 0.5$, and it shows that BY is way more conservative than BH.
    }
    \label{fig:bhy}
\end{figure}
\bigbreak
Both procedures are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:bhy}.
They require $p$-values to be computed, which is not always feasible, especially when $p > n$.
Furthermore, BH and BY have stronger guarantees than desired;
for a desired FDR level $\fdrtarget$,
they ensure that $\fdr \leq \frac{m_0}{p}\fdrtarget$,
and the factor $\frac{m_0}{p}$ might be much smaller than 1.
This is likely to affect the eventual statistical power of the procedure.

Many other FDR control techniques exist~\citep{resampled_fdr_control, unified_fdr_control}
but we won't focus on them.
