\chapter{Fast statistics computation}\label{ch:fsc}

The computation of statistics is a key step in the knockoff selection process described in section~\ref{sec:knockoffs}.
Most statistics control the FDR,
provided that the

However, the power can drastically change depending on how good the statistics are.
In this chapter, we note $X \in \R^{n \times p}$ and $\tX \in \R^{n \times p}$ the original and the knockoff
feature matrices respectively.
We also suppose that the knockoffs were generated respecting the conditions\dots.
Experimentally, it appears that for most tasks the coefficients of a cross-validated Lasso
