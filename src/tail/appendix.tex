\section{SCS and MOSEK convergence times}\label{sec:cvx_times}

Experiments were run in Python using CVX~\cite{cvx} through the Python wrapper CVXPY~\cite{cvxpy}.
Table~\ref{tab:cvx_times_ps} shows the values of $p$ that were used.
We restrained the parameter $p$ for MOSEK as it didn't scale as well as SCS\@.

For each $p$, 5 replications were performed with matrices of the form $M = D + U \Lambda U^\top$ where $D$ is diagonal,
$\diag D \sim \cU\left[ 0,\, 1 \right]$, $U \in \R^{p \times k}$ for $k = 1,\, 5,\, 10,\, 20,\, 50$
are orthonormal random matrices, and $\Lambda \in \R^{k \times k}$ is diagonal and
$\diag \Lambda^2 \sim \cU\left[ 0,\, 1 \right]$.
No significant difference was measured when changing $k$, even for large values.
The convergence is however much slower if $D$ is scaled up.
