      Feature selection is an active area of research in machine learning
      In the past decades
      In this high-dimensional setting,
      that is when the number of features is larger than the number of samples,
      the problem of feature selection becomes particularly challenging.

      Recently, Barber-Cand√®s introduced the knockoffs framework to control the false discovery rate
      when performing feature selection.
      The key idea is to build a knockoff feature for each original feature

      In this master thesis, we focus on the high-dimensional feature selection setting.
      Several bottleneck of the knockoff procedure are addressed.
