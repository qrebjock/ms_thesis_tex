      High-dimensional feature selection has become common in many sciences over the past decades
      because of advancements in data acquisition,
      allowing to record dozens of thousands of features.
      In this master thesis, we focus on false discovery rate control,
      that is the problem of making as many discoveries as possible
      while maintaining the number of false positives under a certain threshold.\\

      Recently~\cite{model_x_knockoffs} introduced the knockoffs framework to control the false discovery rate
      when performing feature selection.
      The key idea is to build a knockoff feature for each original feature, and compare their significance against
      a statistical model.
      Despite the theoretical possibility to employ this framework in high-dimension, several bottlenecks
      make it unemployable in practice.
      We take advantage of low-rank approximations to efficiently build knockoff features in high-dimension,
      and show that alternative significance statistics are faster while maintaining a reasonable statistical power.
      We apply these techniques to genetic data and perform FDR control on
      $\approx 30\,000$ features in a few seconds.\\\\\\
