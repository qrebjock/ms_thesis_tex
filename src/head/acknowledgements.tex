        I am extremely grateful to my master thesis advisor Alexandre d'Aspremont for his relevant insights
        and his patience.
        I would also like to thank Armin Askari and Laurent El Ghaoui with whom I had the opportunity to work,
        and who provided substantial help for the resolution of SDP problems.
        More generally, all the people I met at Sierra and Willow contributed to make this experience
        pleasant and valuable, and I would like to recognize their assistance.
        I also very much appreciate the support of my EPFL advisor Martin Jaggi.
        Finally, I cannot leave EPFL without mentioning my parents who encouraged me throughout my studies.
