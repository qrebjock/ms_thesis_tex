I would like to thank my master thesis advisor Alexandre d'Aspremont who gave me the opportunity to
work.
I would also like to thanks Armin Askari and Laurent El Ghaoui with whom I had the opportunity to work,
and who provided substantial help for the resolution of SDP problems.
Finally, I would like to thank my EPFL advisor Martin Jaggi.
