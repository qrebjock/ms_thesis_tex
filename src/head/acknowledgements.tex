        I would like to thank my master thesis advisor Alexandre d'Aspremont who gave me the opportunity to
        work.
        I would also like to thanks Armin Askari and Laurent El Ghaoui with whom I had the opportunity to work,
        and who provided substantial help for the resolution of SDP problems.
        More generally, to the people I met at Sierra and Willow.
        Finally, I would like to thank my EPFL advisor Martin Jaggi for his support.
