        I am extremely grateful to my master thesis advisor Alexandre d'Aspremont for his relevant insights,
        his patience, who gave me the opportunity to work.
        I would also like to thanks Armin Askari and Laurent El Ghaoui with whom I had the opportunity to work,
        and who provided substantial help for the resolution of SDP problems.
        More generally, all the people I met at Sierra and Willow participated to make this experience
        pleasant and valuable and I would like to recognize their assistance.
        Finally, I very much appreciate the support of my EPFL advisor Martin Jaggi.
        I cannot leave EPFL without mentioning my parents
