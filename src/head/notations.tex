$\N$ denotes the set of natural integers and $\R$ the set of real numbers.
%
Vectors are written in bold letters, e.g. $\xx, \yy \in \R^p$.
%
Matrices are in capital bold letters, e.g. $\mX \in \R^{n \times p}$.
%
We may cast any vector $\xx \in \R^p$ to a column matrix $x \in \R^{p \times 1}$ with the same entry values.
%
We note $\odot$ the Hadamard (element-wise) product between two vectors or matrices.
%
$\0$ and $\1$ are the vectors whose all entries are $0$ and $1$ respectively, and whose size is inferred by the context.
%
For a vector $\vv$, we note $\norm{\vv}_0$ the number of non-zero entries of $\vv$ (that is, its cardinality).
%
The $\diag$ operator can be used in two contexts;
either to transform a vector into a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries match the vector,
or to extract the diagonal of a matrix.
For example
\begin{equation*}
    \diag \begin{bmatrix}
         1\\
         2
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 0\\
        0 & 2
    \end{bmatrix}
    ,\qquad
    \diag \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 2\\
        3 & 4
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
         1\\
         4
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
%
Given two matrices $A$ and $B$, we note $\big[ A, B \big]$ and $\big[ A; B \big]$ their horizontal and
vertical concatenation respectively (if dimensions match).
%
Functions $\R \to \R$ applied to matrices are implicitly performed element-wise, unless otherwise specified.
%
$\E \cX$ denotes the expectation of a random variable (or vector) $\cX$.

Given a set $\cS$, $\abs{\cS}$ and $\#\cS$ denote its cardinality.

The sets of $n \times n$ symmetric matrices,
symmetric positive semidefinite,
and symmetric positive definite
are denoted by $S^n$, $S^n_+$ and $S^n_{++}$ respectively.
